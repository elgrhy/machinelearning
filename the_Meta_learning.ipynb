If you have a large search space and a lot of computational power, then grid search may be the best option. If you have less computational power, then random search or Bayesian optimization may be better options. If you are not sure which technique to use, then you can try a few different techniques and see which one works best for you.\n",

        "* **Tree-based search:** This technique builds a decision tree to guide the search for the optimal hyperparameters. This can be more efficient than grid search or random search, but it can also be more complex.\n",
        "* **Bandit algorithms:** These algorithms use techniques inspired by bandit problems to search for the optimal hyperparameters. These algorithms can be very efficient, but they can also be more difficult to use.\n",
        "* **Meta-learning:** This technique learns from previous experiments to improve the efficiency of the search for the optimal hyperparameters. This can be very efficient, but it can also be more complex.\n",
